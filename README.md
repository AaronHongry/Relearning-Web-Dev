# Relearning Web-Dev

Hello y'all! I am getting back into side projects and to start off, I will be
relearning all the core basics for HTML/CSS/JavaScript, so whatever I work on
here will be just for fun :)
I'll be practicing writing code and be testing new things to add to my
upcoming revamped site!
